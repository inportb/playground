% The procedure below is used for stippling.  Given the optimal size

% width height string StippleFill --
%
% Given a path already set up and a clipping region generated from
% it, this procedure will fill the clipping region with a stipple
% pattern.  "String" contains a proper image description of the
% stipple pattern and "width" and "height" give its dimensions.  Each
% stipple dot is assumed to be about one unit across in the current
% user coordinate system.  This procedure trashes the graphics state.

%		in order from top to bottom.
% spacing -	Spacing between lines.
% xoffset -	Horizontal offset for text bbox relative to x and y: 0 for
%		nw/w/sw anchor, -0.5 for n/center/s, and -1.0 for ne/e/se.
% yoffset -	Vertical offset for text bbox relative to x and y: 0 for
%		nw/n/ne anchor, +0.5 for w/center/e, and +1.0 for sw/s/se.
% justify -	0 for left justification, 0.5 for center, 1 for right justify.
% stipple -	Boolean value indicating whether or not text is to be
%		drawn in stippled fashion.  If text is stippled,
%		procedure StippleText must have been defined to call
%		StippleFill in the right way.
%
% Also, when this procedure is invoked, the color and font must already
% have been set for the text.
